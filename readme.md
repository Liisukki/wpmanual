1. # <a name="_toc168350153"></a>Introduction

This manual is created to help WordPress developers create customized websites. It contains tips on how to create websites with WordPress following some key best practices. It guides through selecting a third-party theme and customizing it and how to start theme development on your own by either creating a child theme or a custom theme from scratch or by using a starter theme. Selecting, using and creating plugins and creating online stores are covered as well.

Since there is no need to recreate the wheel, this manual includes external links and references for more detailed instructions, tips and tutorials on some topics. This is also meant to encourage on to dig deeper into WordPress development and what it can offer.

An example site and theme are used to support this manual. Example executions are included in the document and code commentary is created to provide key information.
